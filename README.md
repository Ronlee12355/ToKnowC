# ToKnowC

I have to say that I am totallt new to language C, but in order to maintain myself in a good coding habit and long programming career in my life, C is what I need to do

In this repo I will implement serveral algorithms and data structures using C, and certainly I am gonna invite my friends to pull request  

* [Say Hello World](https://github.com/Ronlee12355/ToKnowC/blob/master/helloWorld.c)  
* [Recursion](https://github.com/Ronlee12355/ToKnowC/blob/master/recursion.c)   
* [Pointer](https://github.com/Ronlee12355/ToKnowC/blob/master/pointer.c)
